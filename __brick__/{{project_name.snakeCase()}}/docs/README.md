## 💡 Key Concepts

### Clean Architecture
The project uses **4-layer architecture**:
- **Core**: Shared utilities, theme, routing
- **Data**: API, database, models, repositories
- **Domain**: Business logic, entities
- **Presentation**: UI, screens, features

[Learn more →](./Architecture.md)

### Riverpod State Management
Type-safe, compile-time checked state management:
- Providers are containers for state
- Watch for changes in widgets
- Read once for one-time access
- Excellent for testing

[Learn more →](./StateManagement.md)

### Theme System
Centralized styling with light/dark mode support:
- `ColorExtension` for colors
- `TextStyleExtension` for fonts
- `Dimensions` for spacing
- Access via `context.color`, `context.textStyle`, etc.

[Learn more →](./Theme.md)

### Repository Pattern
Abstraction layer for data access:
- Repositories fetch and transform data
- Models represent API data
- Entities represent business data
- Providers use repositories for state

[Learn more →](./ApiIntegration.md#architecture)
